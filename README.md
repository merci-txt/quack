# What is Quack-Keyboard?

Quack-Keyboard is a multi-threaded, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, productivity-enhancing and open-source driver for your keyboard, written in python. Whenever you feel the need to boost your brain-output by 150%, then just start Quack-Keyboard.

## How does it work?

The driver uses the newest OpenAi-GPT4 model to detect a key-press. When detected, the driver will play sounds which contain high amounts of gamma- and sigma-frequencies to help your brain to concentrate better. The frequencies adapt to your typing-behavior as well as your surroundings so it does not matter if you work at home, in the office or on the moon!

## Studies

We have tested Quack-Keyboard at leading tech-companies like Google, Meta, Netflix and Microsoft.
This graph shows how the workflow of over 3000 professional computer-users has improved in just two weeks of using Quack-Keyboard as their daily driver:
